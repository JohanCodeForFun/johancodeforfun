# Application Security Engineer
Application Security Engineer with a Full-Stack & AWS background â€” building and securing apps from code to cloud.

With a foundation in React, Node.js, TypeScript, and databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), I understand applications from a developerâ€™s perspective. Building on this, Iâ€™ve expanded into Application Security and Cloud Security to bridge the gap between developers and security teams.

Need someone with the following skills on your team?
- AppSec skills: OWASP Top 10, API testing, authentication flaws, SQLi/XSS/SSRF exploitation, Burp Suite workflows.
- Cloud: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP), working toward Solutions Architect (SAA-C03) and Security Specialty.
- DevSecOps: Secure CI/CD pipelines with automated SAST, DAST, dependency & secrets scanning.
- Pentesting mindset: Ongoing PortSwigger training (BSCP prep) and hands-on labs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox).

Certifications (completed & in progress):
- AWS CCP âœ…
- Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (Nov 2025 target)
- AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (Dec 2025 target)
- eWPT + OSWE (2026 roadmap)

My goal: To combine development + AppSec + cloud expertise and help teams build secure products end-to-end.
